Planning out your project before executing the actual code makes an unbelievable difference in efficiency and helps keep you on track to reach the goal.

I thought it was over my head for the longest time, decided to forgo the opportunity to learn again in college and eventually ended up feeling stagnant after a few years at my former company. After finding Boca Code and realizing that I had a tangible opportunity to make software engineering my career, I finally decided to take the chance I didn’t take when I was younger. I could not be more thrilled with my decision."
